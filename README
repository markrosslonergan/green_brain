This is a standard SBNfit generation of NC events at the SBN facility

Genie files are located in ..

STEP 1 is to generate the SBNspec

running example from withing build/src/

./NCsbn --xml ../../NCsbn.xml


Now (8th November) I am going to write a small program to actually calculate the osc and bounds
--> Write up an SBNosc that works (Write a osc_pattern in xml?) That would probably work ya?
--> Generate the grid
--> Run first results by tomorrow?
