This is a standard SBNfit generation of NC events at the SBN facility

Genie files are located in ..

STEP 1 is to generate the SBNspec

running example from withing build/src/

./NCsbn --xml ../../NCsbn.xml


precomp directory must be where precomped spectra go

Currently you can choose to generate a normal dataset, or to generate precomputed things (see main function of NCsbn.cxx)

Once generated, (as pure SBNspec files), we can hopefully just use the standard SBNosc file, with appropiate oscillation_patterns in the xml file, to oscillate and finish it all.


Now (8th November) I am going to write a small program to actually calculate the osc and bounds
--> Write up an SBNosc that works (Write a osc_pattern in xml?) That would probably work ya?
--> Generate the grid
--> Run first results by tomorrow?
